# Pickup-Lang
Pickup is a lightweight scripting language inspired by Lua, designed as a modern drop-in replacement. It features 0-based indexing, optional static typing, standard libraries (JSON, FS, etc.), improved error handling, and a clean module systemâ€”built with performance and embeddability in mind.
